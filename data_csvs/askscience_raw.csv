One statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and I'm glad it is taking place.

Another point brought up was education and degrees. In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent.

FAQ:

&gt; Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

&gt; How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

&gt; Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

&gt; Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

&gt; What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

&gt; How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.

First of all, I'm gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: As an example, ""Tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""Tawat 'ankhu qaman"" ([taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn]).

* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u/Ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point. 

Thanks so much for all the great answers, everyone. It totally answered my question and questions I didn't know I had.

Obviously I&amp;#39;ll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I&amp;#39;m gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in &amp;quot;is/us/os&amp;quot; are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by &lt;a href=""/u/goltrpoat""&gt;u/goltrpoat&lt;/a&gt;: As an example, &amp;quot;Tutankhamen&amp;quot; (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like &amp;quot;Tawat &amp;#39;ankhu qaman&amp;quot; ([taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for &amp;quot;mouth&amp;quot; may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (&amp;quot;ro&amp;quot;) and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See &lt;a href=""/u/Ramast""&gt;u/Ramast&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#39;s comment to see his full explanation on this point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for all the great answers, everyone. It totally answered my question and questions I didn&amp;#39;t know I had. &lt;/p&gt;

*Summary:* We are a team of astronomers running a campaign called the Pale Red Dot. We have found definitive evidence of a planet in orbit around the closest star to Earth, besides the Sun. The star is called Proxima Centauri and lies just over 4 light-years from us. The planet we've discovered is now called Proxima b and this makes it the closest exoplanet to us and therefore the main target should we ever develop the necessary technologies to travel to a planet outside the Solar System. 

Our results have just been published today in Nature, but our observing campaign lasted from mid January to April 2016. We have kept a blog about the entire process here: [www.palereddot.org](http://www.palereddot.org/) and have also communicated via Twitter @Pale_Red_Dot and Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/](https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/)

Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.

Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.

So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.

Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.

So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.

Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?

Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.

The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.

I made a drawing to make my question clearer : [Drawing](http://imgur.com/a/C84eq)

 *The three panels on the left represent the universe in 2D and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. The star is any star and the black dot represents the Earth. The arrow is the light emited from the star.*

 *The three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the Earth.*

 * The first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited

 * On the second line of the ""comic"" you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. What we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !

 * On the third line I was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. We would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?


**To recap**

It sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?

**EDIT**

Christ this blew up over the week-end while I was away, I will try to read everything as soon as possible. 

Also thank you for the gilding ! Even if I have no clue what it does, I feel like someone now !

**Edit:** So far in this thread, we have two points being made on the usefullness of the masks: 

1. They prevent hand to mouth/nose touching. 

2. They prevent saliva, mucus/phlegm projection into someone's face, as well as receiving some from the projection of others in close quarters.

Sounds good to me. 

So yes, they are useful, but not as a definitive deterent for airborn disease.

* Other types of masks and filters may be used for air transmitted bacteria and viruses.

- No one that I could notice here has put forward any data on international reported flu/cold rates to draw a rough comparrison between Japan and the world.

This is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. 

But Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. 

So is force really mass x acceleration? Where is this discontinuity coming from?

But do the different hazards actually affect firefighting practice, or do firefighters have a generic approach anyway?

UPDATE 19 June: Wow. Thanks for awesome answers everyone. I'll attempt to do a brief summary:

* It's not a major issue for putting out the initial fire. Water can still be used. A spray of individual droplets doesn't provide a conductive path.

* It *is* a concern for cutting people out of a crashed vehicle. Responders must be careful not to cut through energised high voltage wiring. But non-electric cars also have hazards to cutting such as airbags.

* It's a concern for removing and storing the wreck. Li-ion batteries can reignite after seemingly being extinguished and this can go on for days.

* Vehicle manufacturers provide fire departments with safety information, for example diagrams of where not to cut a vehicle.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to petrol or diesel car fires.

The datasets include over 100 TB of data from proton collisions at 7 TeV, making up half the data collected by the CMS detector in 2011. The data are provided in the format that is used by CMS scientists for performing physics analyses. We have also provided 200 TB of simulated data (*Monte Carlo*) generated with the same software version that should be used to analyse the primary datasets.

**About the CERN Open Data Portal**

&gt; The CERN Open Data portal is the access point to a growing range of data produced through the research performed at CERN. It disseminates the preserved output from various research activities, including accompanying software and documentation that is needed to understand and analyse the data being shared.

&gt; The portal adheres to established global standards in data preservation and Open Science: the products are shared under open licences; they are issued with a digital object identifier (DOI) to make them citable objects in the scientific discourse.

**About CERN**

&gt; [CERN](http://home.cern) is the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, located in Geneva, Switzerland. Its flagship accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has four main particle detectors: [ALICE](http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html), [ATLAS](http://atlas.cern), [CMS](http://cms.web.cern.ch) and [LHCb](http://cern.ch/lhcb-public).

**Our experts are here to answer your questions, and this year we have a treat that's *almost* sweeter than pi: we've teamed up with some experts from /r/AskHistorians to bring you the history of pi.** We'd like to extend a special thank you to these users for their contributions here today!

Here's some reading from /u/Jooseman to get us started:

&gt; The symbol π was not known to have been introduced to represent the number until 1706, when Welsh Mathematician William Jones (a man who was also close friends with Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Edmund Halley) used it in his work *Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos* (or a *New Introduction to the Mathematics*.) There are several possible reasons that the symbol was chosen. The favourite theory is because it was the initial of the ancient Greek word for periphery (the circumference).

&gt; Before this time the symbol π has also been used in various other mathematical concepts, including different concepts in Geometry, where William Oughtred (1574-1660) used it to represent the periphery itself, meaning it would vary with the diameter instead of representing a constant like it does today (Oughtred also introduced a lot of other notation). In Ancient Greece it represented the number 80.

&gt; The story of its introduction does not end there though. It did not start to see widespread usage until Leonhard Euler began using it, and through his prominence and widespread correspondence with other European Mathematicians, it's use quickly spread. Euler originally used the symbol p, but switched beginning with his 1736 work *Mechanica* and finally it was his use of it in the widely read *Introductio* in 1748 that really helped it spread.

&lt;p&gt;Before this time the symbol π has also been used in various other mathematical concepts, including different concepts in Geometry, where William Oughtred (1574-1660) used it to represent the periphery itself, meaning it would vary with the diameter instead of representing a constant like it does today (Oughtred also introduced a lot of other notation). In Ancient Greece it represented the number 80.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of its introduction does not end there though. It did not start to see widespread usage until Leonhard Euler began using it, and through his prominence and widespread correspondence with other European Mathematicians, it&amp;#39;s use quickly spread. Euler originally used the symbol p, but switched beginning with his 1736 work &lt;em&gt;Mechanica&lt;/em&gt; and finally it was his use of it in the widely read &lt;em&gt;Introductio&lt;/em&gt; in 1748 that really helped it spread.&lt;/p&gt;

I am not sure wether this is the correct place to ask this question but here goes.
Does the force of gravity travel at the speed of light? 

I have read some articles that we haven't confirmed this experimentally.
If I understand this correctly newtonian gravity claims instant force..
So that's a no-go.
Now I wonder how accurate relativistic calculations are and how much room they allow for deviations.( 99%c for example)
Are we experiencing the gravity of the sun 499 seconds ago?

Sorry , i did not mean the force of gravity but the gravitational waves .

I am sorry if I upset some people asking this question, I am just trying to grasp the fundamental forces as we understand them.

It will take some explanation before I get to my question again but it's there:

I was working on a math puzzle a while back where I had to guess the next number in a series. The given series was ""1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, __"" and I had to guess the last number. I guessed correctly, but instead of intuitively realizing that the pattern was "" x^2 "", I found the answer via another method.

I found the differences between the adjacent numbers in the series, i.e. 4 - 1 = 3, 9 - 4 = 5, so on, and used those to create a new series: ""3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13"". I then performed the same operation on that line, finding the differences between adjacent numbers and then using those to create a new line: ""2, 2, 2, 2, 2"".

I thought this was interesting, because by performing this differences method twice on my given series, I was able to bottom-out/hit a ceiling at the number 2*. The number 2 was useful, because I could then work my way back down/up (depends on how you write it down, I guess) to find the next number in the series: 64.

I decided to try this again on a new, related series. I made the series ""1, 8, 27, 64, 125"" ( x^3 ) and resolved to use the same differences method on this line. The first time yields: 7, 19, 37, 61""; the second time yields: ""12, 18, 24""; the third time bottoms out at: ""6, 6"".

So ( x^2 ) bottoms out at 2*, and ( x^3 ) bottoms out at 6*.

I continued this with ( x^4 ): ""1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401"". The differences method yields: ""15, 65, 175, 369, 671, 1105""; again, and it yields: ""50, 110, 194, 302, 434""; again, and it yields: ""60, 84, 108, 132""; again, and it yields: ""24, 24, 24"".

So ( x^4 ) bottoms out at 24*.

Finally, my question: Is there a name for these bedrock numbers that I've marked with the asterisks? 

Additionally, I would like to know: is there reading material on the matter? Is there a more elegant way of finding the bedrock number that underlies a given exponent?

tl;dr:

2 underlies ( x^2 ),
6 underlies ( x^3 ),
24 underlies ( x^4 ),
and so on, for reasons explained above.

The oceans cover more than 70 percent of the planet and hold the key to many critical challenges facing science and society, from sustainably feeding human populations to addressing the impacts of climate change to protecting vulnerable marine species.

One of the cornerstone methods of keeping tabs on the oceans is through innovative tools and technologies to monitor them. At Scripps Oceanography we contribute to several ocean observation systems and networks that relay critical data about the seas and how they are changing. These include networks just off our populated coastlines (Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System, (http://www.sccoos.org/)) for applications as diverse as marine operations, coastal hazards, and ecosystems, to far out at sea where it's not easy to access information (Argo, (http://argo.ucsd.edu/)) to help us understand phenomena such as El Niños and ocean warming.

We are Dr. Mads Daugaard, Dr. Nader Al Nakouzi, Chris Wang, and Gunjan Kumar from the Vancouver Prostate Centre. We are part of the group that recently published a study detailing the use of a malaria protein, VAR2CSA, as a new and novel way of targeting cancers.


Cancer and the placenta show many similar characteristics. However, scientists have spent decades trying to find biochemical similarities between placenta tissue and cancer. Together with our colleagues from University of Copenhagen we discovered how malaria uses VAR2CSA to embed itself in the placenta and how the same target is present on cancer cells. Based on that discovery we immediately saw its potential to deliver cancer drugs in a precise, controlled way to tumors.


New and novel ways of targeting cancers are needed in order to combat the disease. With a recombinant version of VAR2CSA, we hope to develop a promising therapy for a broad spectrum of different cancers.

&lt;p&gt;Cancer and the placenta show many similar characteristics. However, scientists have spent decades trying to find biochemical similarities between placenta tissue and cancer. Together with our colleagues from University of Copenhagen we discovered how malaria uses VAR2CSA to embed itself in the placenta and how the same target is present on cancer cells. Based on that discovery we immediately saw its potential to deliver cancer drugs in a precise, controlled way to tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New and novel ways of targeting cancers are needed in order to combat the disease. With a recombinant version of VAR2CSA, we hope to develop a promising therapy for a broad spectrum of different cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be answering your questions at 1pm EST (10am PST). Ask Us Anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Hello Reddit! Thank you all for the wonderful questions, we are here to answer what ever question you have for us for the next hour. Ask away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Hi All! Thank you all so much for all the questions again, we had a blast answering everything we can. However, we must be go back to work now! We will come back through out the day and answer more questions when we have time. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST :D&lt;/p&gt;

This was completely new to me (which is to no surprise, I'm quite illiterate in neurophysiology) and I'm fascinated by the idea. The first thing I did is checked if his works are legit and if he has publications in respectable magazines, which he seem to have. He also doesn't look like a usual ""science freak"" which are plenty around here. However, I tried to google some popular articles in English about that but haven't found much.

Strange question.  But I was watching a neighbor pass by my house on a skateboard today, and I started wondering about the physics of it.  Obviously, he was moving between points A and B on his journey faster than he would be walking.  But then again, he also has to occasionally use one foot to push against the ground several times to keep the momentum of the skateboard moving forward at a higher speed than if he was just walking.

My question is basically is he ending up expending the SAME amount of total energy by the ""pushing"" of his one foot while using the skateboard as he would if he was just walking the same distance traveled using two feet?  

Assume all other things are equal, as in the ground being level in the comparison, etc.

My intuition says there is no such thing as a ""free energy lunch"".  That regardless of how he propels his body between two points, he would have to expend the same amount of energy regardless whether he was walking or occasionally pushing the skateboard with one foot.  But I'm not sure about that right now.  Are there any other factors involved that would change the energy requirement expended? Like the time vs distance traveled in each case?

Hi Reddit! 


I study how we can create incredibly detailed memories of things that never actually happened. In particular, I implant rich false memories of committing crime with police contact and other highly emotional autobiographical events. I thought I’d share my work with the community, since I’m an avid Redditor.


The technique I use in my research is essentially a combination of what's called “mis-information"" (telling people convincingly that something happened that didn’t) and an imagination exercise which makes a participant picture the event happening. The goal is to get my participants to confuse their imagination with their memory. I find, as do many other scientists who study memory, that it is often surprisingly easy to implant memories. All of my participants are healthy young adults, and in my last study 70% of them were classified as having formed these full false memories of crime by the end of the study. I am currently working on further research and analysis to see whether I can replicate this, since this success rate was incredibly high.


Last year some of this research, which I did with Stephen Porter at UBC, went viral. It was so amazing to see such a great reaction from the press and public. There really seems to be a thirst for wanting to understand our faulty memories. You can see my favourite write up of the research [here] (http://bigthink.com/neurobonkers/how-did-researchers-convince-so-many-people-they-had-committed-a-violent-crime).  In “[Memory Hackers](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/memory-hackers.html),” a NOVA documentary airing tonight on PBS at 9pm Eastern time, you can actually see some real footage from the videos that I made during the interviews, which you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58AxIGmjEP4).  
 

I actually have a whole book coming out this summer on memory hacking. It’s the first popular science book of it’s kind, and I’m super excited about it! If you find my research interesting you’ll definitely like the book. The book will be released in 8 languages (English, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Italian, Taiwanese, Chinese, and Japanese) and will be called “The Memory Illusion”. You can get preliminary information about it [here](http://www.drjuliashaw.com/the-memory-illusion.html).

Hannah Morris: http://chenaconsultingservices.weebly.com/about-me.html

I grew up caving and climbing with my family in northwest Georgia, and got involved in archaeology in college. I traveled around as a “shovelbum” for a few years, hopping between Mexico and Alaska and the southeast U.S. I started working with the American Museum of Natural History on a barrier island, St. Catherine’s Island, off the coast of Georgia in 2008. I’ve excavated in some unusual and intense circumstances, keeping an eye out for moose and bear in Alaska and working in the marsh in a rising tide in Georgia. I was actually on a dig on the island when I came in from the field one day and saw the job posting on Facebook. I had a very interesting interview with Lee via Skype, and then within 2 weeks I was on a plane headed for Joburg. The project has been one of the most incredible experiences I’ve ever had, for so many reasons. Obviously, the science is amazing, and how we excavated the site and what we found is going to change paleoanthropology forever. In addition to the scientific impact, the Rising Star Expedition has had a huge personal impact on us all, I think. It’s very exciting to be involved with so many wonderful people, who are so dedicated to this common goal of advancing and promoting science, and it’s been really rewarding to see the public get involved and excited about this project.

Becca Peixotto: @beccapeixotto

I heard about the famous Facebook ad from a friend who forwarded it to me with a note “this sounds like you.” A small archaeologist with caving and climbing experience for a mysterious expedition in South Africa?  I sent my CV to Lee, talked with him over Skype and just a few weeks later I was arriving in Jo’burg. My previous career (with which I am still involved sometimes) was in outdoor and experiential education. I led wilderness expeditions including rock climbing and caving in mountain and desert environments for Outward Bound and other organizations (and I’ve done those activities on countless personal adventures too). Joining Rising Star was an exciting way to out my technical outdoor skills to use in my other passion of archaeology. I often find myself excavating in remote, inaccessible locations with challenging environments like the Rising Star cave or the remote interior of the Great Dismal Swamp (VA and NC- the location of my PhD research). It has been such a joy and privilege to be a part of Rising Star. The fossil discovery is mind-blowing in itself but Rising Star has also raised the bar for how paleoanthropology happens: where we look, the technology we use to record sites, who gets to excavate and analyze the fossils and how we communicate the process of doing this kind of science with the world.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah Morris and Becca Peixotto are two of six scientists comprising the Advance Science Team on the &lt;a href=""http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/blog/rising-star-expedition/""&gt;Rising Star Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, led by paleoanthropologist and National Geographic explorer-in-residence Lee Berger.

&lt;p&gt;I heard about the famous Facebook ad from a friend who forwarded it to me with a note “this sounds like you.” A small archaeologist with caving and climbing experience for a mysterious expedition in South Africa?  I sent my CV to Lee, talked with him over Skype and just a few weeks later I was arriving in Jo’burg. My previous career (with which I am still involved sometimes) was in outdoor and experiential education. I led wilderness expeditions including rock climbing and caving in mountain and desert environments for Outward Bound and other organizations (and I’ve done those activities on countless personal adventures too). Joining Rising Star was an exciting way to out my technical outdoor skills to use in my other passion of archaeology. I often find myself excavating in remote, inaccessible locations with challenging environments like the Rising Star cave or the remote interior of the Great Dismal Swamp (VA and NC- the location of my PhD research). It has been such a joy and privilege to be a part of Rising Star. The fossil discovery is mind-blowing in itself but Rising Star has also raised the bar for how paleoanthropology happens: where we look, the technology we use to record sites, who gets to excavate and analyze the fossils and how we communicate the process of doing this kind of science with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

The numbers are:&lt;br/&gt;

- Tre&lt;br/&gt;

...&lt;br/&gt;

...&lt;br/&gt;
- Venti (20)&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the pattern emerges from 20 as well.&lt;br/&gt;

* Dr. Daniel Promislow, Professor at the University of Washington Departments of Biology and Pathology, co-director of the Dog Aging Project

Our goal is to define the biological and environmental factors that influence healthy aging in dogs at high resolution, and to use this information to improve the quality and quantity of life for our pets.  So far, most scientific research on the biology of aging (geroscience) has been conducted in the lab under standardized conditions. Results from these studies have been quite encouraging (for example, Matt's group has recently managed to extend life expectancy in middle-aged mice by 60%). We believe that the domestic dog is ideally suited to bring this work out of the lab and into the real world.  There are many reasons why dogs are uniquely suited for this effort, including that they share our environment, receive comparable medical care, are affected by many of the same age-related diseases, and have excellent health and life span data available.

While aging is not a disease, it is the most important risk factor for a wide range of diseases such as cancer, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, kidney failure and so on. Therefore, by targeting the biological mechanisms of aging, we can expect to see benefits across the spectrum of those otherwise unrelated diseases - which has lead us to state that healthy aging is in fact *The Ultimate Preventive Medicine.*

Our hope is that by understanding the biological and environmental factors that influence the length of time an individual lives in good health (what we call 'healthspan'), we can better understand how to maximize each individual dog's healthspan. Having dogs live and stay healthy for longer will be beneficial for both the dogs and their owners. Moreover, given that dogs live in the same environment as we do, what we learn about healthspan in dogs is likely to apply to humans as well – so understanding healthy aging in dogs might help us to learn how to ensure the highest level of health at old age for humans. 

We welcome interested citizen scientists to sign up their dogs to be considered for [two studies](http://dogagingproject.com/project-details/):

* *The Longitudinal Study* will study 10,000 dogs (our 'foundation cohort') of all breeds and ages throughout North America. This intensively studied cohort will be followed through regular owner questionnaires, yearly vet visits including bloodwork, and information about in-home behavior, environmental quality, and more. In a subset of these dogs (our 'precision cohort'), we will also include annual studies of state-of-the-art molecular biology ('epigenome', 'microbiome' and 'metabolome') information. Our goal is to better understand how biology and the environment affect aging and health. Results from this study should help us to better predict and diagnose disease earlier, and so improve our ability to treat and prevent disease. There are no health, size or age requirements for dogs to be eligible to participate in this study.
* *The Interventional Study* will test the effects of a drug called rapamycin on healthspan and lifespan in dogs. This is a drug that has shown promising effects on aging in a wide variety of species, and based on those results we expect to see a 2 to 5 year increase in healthy lifespan in dogs. We have previously tested rapamycin in a pilot study on healthy dogs for 10 weeks and found improved heart function that was specific to age-related changes, and no significant adverse side effects. For the Interventional Study, we will treat 300 healthy middle-aged dogs with either rapamycin or a placebo for several years and compare health outcomes and mortality between the two groups. To be eligible to participate, dogs will need to be healthy, at least six years of age at the beginning of the study, and weigh at least 18 kg (40 lbs). 

The Dog Aging Project believes in the value of *Open Science*. We will collect an enormous amount of data for this project - enough to keep scores of scientists busy for many years. Other than any personal information about owners, we will make all of our data publicly available so that scientists and veterinarians around the world can make discoveries. We are also dedicated to Citizen Science, and will endeavor to create ways for all dog owners to become a part of the process of scientific discovery as the Dog Aging Project moves forward.

We'll be on at noon pacific time (3 PM ET, 19 UT), ask us anything!

Currently I am an assistant professor in Biological Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside.

**From Dr. Drumheller-Horton:** My research falls into two broad fields: taphonomy (the study of everything that happens to an organism from when it dies until when we find it) and crocodylian evolution/behavior.

**Texas was a very different place 95 million years ago.** Dinosaurs and crocodiles dominated a lush coast, preserved as a rich fossil bed in Dallas-Forth Worth called the Arlington Archosaur Site (AAS). The AAS is an important, productive fossil locality that preserves a previously unknown fauna from this part of North America. 

The rocks here contain a rare record of ecosystem transition, when major groups of dinosaurs and other animals were changing significantly. The AAS preserves a nearly complete coastal ecosystem, providing an unparalleled glimpse into the life that existed here over 95 million years ago. Thousands of specimens have been recovered including previously unknown dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, mammals, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and plants. The diversity, abundance, and quality of the material is extraordinary. 

The site is run in partnership with amateur volunteers, creating a unique citizen-science initiative with far-reaching education opportunities for the surrounding community. You can find us on Facebook [here](https://www.facebook.com/Arlington-Archosaur-Site-188601874524788/)!

Individual decisions have a huge influence on the amount of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere, and thus the pace of climate change.

The findings show that many of the most commonly adopted strategies are far less effective than the ones we don't ordinarily hear about. Namely, having one fewer child, which would result in an average of 58.6 metric tons of CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions for developed countries per year. The next most effective items on the list are living car-free (2.4 tCO2e per year), avoiding air travel (1.6 tCO2e per year) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tCO2e per year). Commonly mentioned actions like recycling are much less effective (0.2 tCO2e per year). Given these findings, we say that education should focus on high-impact changes that have a greater potential to reduce emissions, rather than low-impact actions that are the current focus of high school science textbooks and government recommendations.
 
The research is meant to guide those who want to curb their contribution to the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, rather than to instruct individuals on the personal decisions they make.

People (including me) have asked, if Kepler 452b had Earth-equivalent technology, and were transmitting television and radio and whatever else, would we be able to detect it. Most answers I've seen dodged the question by pointing out that Kepler 452b is 1600 light years away, so if they were equal to us now, then, we wouldn't get anything because their transmissions wouldn't arrive here until 1600 years from now.

Which is missing the point. The real question is, if they had *at least* our technology from roughly 1600 years ago, and we pointed out absolute best receivers at it, could we *then* ""hear"" anything?

Someone seemed to have answered this in a roundabout way by saying that the New Horizons is barely out of our solar system and we can hardly hear it, and it's designed to transmit to us, so, no, we probably couldn't receive any incidental transmissions from somewhere 1600 light years away.

So, if that's true, then what is the deal with SETI? Does it assume there are civilizations out there doing stuff on a huge scale, way, way bigger than us that we could recieve it from thousands of light years away? Is it assuming that they are transmitting something directly at us?

What is SETI doing if it's near impossible for us to overhear anything from planets like ours that we know about?


**EDIT:** Thank you everyone for the thought provoking responses. I'm sorry it's a little hard to respond to all of them.

Where I am now after considering all the replies, is that /u/rwired (currently most upvoted response) pointed out that SETI can detect signals from transmission-capable planets up to 1000ly away. This means that it's not the case that SETI can't confirm life on planets that Kepler finds, it's just that Kepler has a bigger range.

I also understand, as another poster mentioned, that Kepler wasn't necessarily meant to find life supporting planets, just to find planets, and finding life supporting planets is just a bonus.

Still... it seems to me that, unless there's a technical limitation I don't yet get, that it would have been the best of all possible results for Kepler to first look for planets within SETI range before moving beyond. That way, we could have SETI perform a much more targeted search.

Is there no way SETI and Kepler can join forces, in a sense?

edit: 

Hello everyone, I appreciate all the feedback received from this post and I'm grateful for such well presented answers. I realise that this sort of question can raise many different answers due to the question being too general. 

But as I understand from most of the replies... The reason the light from those stars will never entirely vanish is because even when the star/galaxy passes the cosmological event horizon, the space between us and them is only expanding and so the light that was sent before the star/galaxy passing the cosmological event horizon will only stretch due to the expansion and continue to reach us but through other spectrums of light as it continues to redshift. Would this be correct? 

I would also like to bring forward a question that has been brought up by a few other redditors. However as it may seem there is no exact answer to it, I'd like to ask a question similar to it:

Which stars/galaxies have most noticeably redshifted or faded from visual light? I'd definitely like to read up on this topic so any names or articles would be great.

My research is about what happens to our memories when we cannot remember. When we experience memory loss, does it mean that these memories have been erased? Could it be that some memories exist in our brains but we are unable to find and recall them? These questions led me to study memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In addition to the impact AD has on our community, watching my own grandmother gradually forget drives me to the laboratory everyday with the hope that someday we will be able to help AD patients remember.


To study memory brain structures affected by AD, I use animal models that closely mimic the human condition. From patients, we know that initial stages of AD (known as “early AD”) are diagnosed when consecutive memory tests result in extremely poor performance. In particular, early AD patients seem to lose memories of events/episodes such as birthday parties, summer vacations with the family, high school reunions, etc. It has been assumed that early AD patients lose critical memory information and therefore cannot remember. My recent work (link to nature study: http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17172) using animal models challenges this widely held assumption. Not only did we find that early AD mice still stored the supposedly lost memories, but we found a way to bring these memories back. Given this work, I believe that memory loss in early stages of AD is because patients are unable find and retrieve the information, rather than a permanent loss of memory information. 


Even though this particular work was done using animal models, I have hope that in the future we can learn more about retrieving lost memories in early AD patients. For a perspective on my recent work by expert memory researchers, go here (link to nature news and views: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature17312.html).

A while back, I got interested in Peto’s Paradox: the observation that big and long-lived organisms like elephants and whales don’t get cancer as often as we think they should. If all cells have a similar risk of developing cancer, then really large animals should be at really high risk.

But there’s absolutely no correlation between body size or lifespan and cancer rates.

So we studied elephant genomes, and now we think we’ve found the mechanism that explains the paradox. Elephants have 20 copies of the very well-known p53 tumor suppressor gene (to be precise: one p53 gene and 19 p53 retrogenes).

We looked in 60+ other animals, including whales, fish, birds, and humans, but found that only elephants (and maybe bats) have more than one p53 gene. We looked in woolly mammoth and mastodon genomes as well, and shed some light onto the evolutionary origins of p53 expansion (if you’re curious about mammoth genomes I did [another AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3csgs6/science_ama_series_im_vinny_lynch_geneticist_at/) a few months ago). Lastly, we transferred one of the extra p53 genes from elephants into mouse cells that we grew in the lab and made some pretty interesting observations.

We released our findings on the [open-access preprint server BioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/06/028522), and another group, which came to pretty much the same conclusion but focused mostly only on elephants and humans, independently released theirs in [JAMA](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2456041). You can read an article about [our two studies in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/science/why-elephants-get-less-cancer.html).

I am particularly excited about including autistic adults in our new journal - as editorial board members, authors, reviewers and readers. As a doctor and a services researcher, my own research is focused on how people on the autism spectrum can get better access to health care services. Many autistic adults don't get the health care they need, resulting in more health problems and shorter life expectancy.  Ask me anything about the new journal or the ways that people on the autism spectrum can get better care. 

We'll be on at 1 p.m. Pacific (4 PM ET, 21 UT), we're looking forward to the session!

&lt;p&gt;Edit:  Going to edit to clarify my intentions:  14 year old me, sophomore in HS, was bored one day, and wondered if there was a fire cold enough I could hold it, touch it, be engulfed in it, without being harmed.  &lt;a href=""/u/legalizegaypot""&gt;/u/legalizegaypot&lt;/a&gt; hit the nail on the head with his expanding of the question.  Now, while I love the theoretical discussions, my original intention was to find the coldest fire that could be produced from known materials.

Tanh(x)+0.1x has a nice continuous derivative. 1-f(x)^2 +0.1 and no need to define things piecewise. It still has a nice activation threshold but just doesn't saturate.

Sorry if this is a dumb idea. I am just trying to understand and figure someone must have tried something like this.

EDIT

Thanks for the responses. It sounds like the answer is that some of my assumptions were wrong.

1. Looks like a continuous derivative is not that important. I wanted things to be differential everywhere and thought I had read that was desirable, but looks like that is not so important.
2. Speed of computing the transfer function seems to be far more important than I had thought. ReLU is certainly cheaper.
3. Things like SELU and PReLU are similar which approach it from the other angle. Making ReLU continuous rather than making something like tanh() fixing the saturation/vanishing grad issues . I am still not sure why that approach is favored but probably again for speed concerns.

I will probably end up having to just test tanh(x)+cx vs SELU, I will be surprised if the results are very different. If any of the ML experts out there want to collaborate/teach a physicist more about DNN send me a message. :)

I think that would clear a lot of this up.

Edit 2: Now that more people have added their input, it looks like my initial assumption, that a continuous current requires a continuous input of energy, was wrong. The only energy required is the up-front energy to apply the initial voltage to the rails. After that, the circuit continues to run without the need for more energy. Thus, the only energy spent while the train is levitating (not including propulsion) is due to losses from resistance. With that in mind, and with the fact that no energy is required to suspend an object at a constant height, it makes sense that levitation is such a small portion of the energy used. As u/Wheed_O_Whirler pointed out, that amount is actually less energy than is used by the air conditioner.

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Now that more people have added their input, it looks like my initial assumption, that a continuous current requires a continuous input of energy, was wrong. The only energy required is the up-front energy to apply the initial voltage to the rails. After that, the circuit continues to run without the need for more energy. Thus, the only energy spent while the train is levitating (not including propulsion) is due to losses from resistance. With that in mind, and with the fact that no energy is required to suspend an object at a constant height, it makes sense that levitation is such a small portion of the energy used. As &lt;a href=""/u/Wheed_O_Whirler""&gt;u/Wheed_O_Whirler&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, that amount is actually less energy than is used by the air conditioner. Thanks to everyone who helped explain that.&lt;/p&gt;

To our new visitors, welcome to this special corner of reddit where we ask and answer science questions 24/7!

Here's how it works: You come up with scientific questions that pique your interest, and get answers based on solid science from experts and knowledgeable members of the AskScience community. To keep our content high quality, we encourage you to post comments that...

* ...are on topic, factual, and scientific

* ...clarify questions and answers

* ...link to peer reviewed literature

* ...are free of idle guesses, speculation, and anecdotes.

More extensive posting and upvoting guidelines can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/guidelines). This community promotes high quality posts by upvoting science that's worth reading. Jokes, memes, [medical advice](http://www.reddit.com/s4chc), and off-topic banter are downvoted and reported. We remove these items to keep the discussion focused on science. Sometimes it is very convenient to phrase a follow-up post as a question to continue the discussion.

Keep an eye out for AskScience panelists. They are experts with at minimum, postgraduate experience in their field. They are are highly knowledgable contributors who are responsible for some of the best content that is posted to AskScience. If you qualify, we highly encourage you to make some posts to AskScience so you can [apply for flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1axwqz/askscience_panel_of_scientists_viii/).

You don't have to be a panelist to answer questions in AskScience, but we do ask that you be educated in the field of the question you are answering. You should be prepared to substantiate your answers. Try to give answers that are scientific, but are at a level where someone without a background in the field can understand them.

Many questions submitted to AskScience undergo an editorial process before they appear. Not all questions make it to the front page. Please [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faskscience) if something is amiss -- we're here to help.

We'd now like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who's helped bring us here today.

First, we'd like to give a big thank you to the [reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/about/team/) and /u/hueypriest in particular for making this happen. We're very grateful for their enthusiasm and support for science content on reddit. We're thrilled to have the opportunity to do on a larger scale what AskScience does best.

Next, we want to thank all of our panelists for continuing to share with us your insights and fascinating ideas about science. Your expertise and patience in answering questions is what has made our subreddit stand out as a source for enlightening scientific discourse.

Finally, to our nearly 800,000 AskScience subscribers -- thank you for your continued support. Your enthusiasm and thirst for knowledge is truly inspirational. It is a major reason why we volunteer everyday to keep this place running. We realize that we couldn't have come this far without you, and it was a major consideration in our decision to return this subreddit back to default. Many of you are visible ambassadors of AskScience and play a critical role in our success. 

Please continue to welcome new redditors to this community and share the [best of reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) that AskScience has to offer.

It's been a fantastic journey growing this subreddit from a handful of subscribers to the very popular forum that it is today. That said, we understand that many of you might have concerns about how being a default subreddit might change things here. Rest assured, the mods are keeping a close eye on things, and we will chart AskScience's future based on what we see from this new traffic.

This is a great moment to reflect and look forward to the future. To celebrate, please share your thoughts about AskScience below!

It looks like a team from Duke were able to train subjects with paralysis using VR headsets each day to slowly allow them to recover some(?) movement/sensation. 

Even if it was a small amount it is stil really impressive, but what I don't understand is ""how"" this works? 

Does this only work for certain types of paralysis? (i.e. if the spinal cord is severed surely there is no chance of any repair without surgery/physical treatment?)

If this works, could it be rolled out without the need for a treatment team? i.e. an app + headset would allow anyone who fits the criteria to benefit?

Is it conceivable that anything could be constructed that could survive passing through the corona? It seems stuff must be whipping around like crazy in there, plus the insane temperatures. To my knowledge the highest known melting points are in the thousands of degrees, but I figure there is also some kind of blast force or something going on there.

*Edit* and if the corona is so easy, can you conceive of a spacecraft passing through the *photosphere* and surviving?

Not that it is possible with any known technology, but is it even physically conceivable that something could survive a close approach towards the surface of the sun? What would be necessary (special materials? some kind of super-magnet?)?
